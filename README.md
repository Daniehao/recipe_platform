This recipe web application enables users to view recipes, search recipes by keyword, upload their recipes, edit/view/delete their uploaded recipes. A registered user is required for uploading and modifying recipes. Search recipe function can be used without registration. The screenshot is how the website looks like.

### Follow the steps to go through all functions
#### Search for a recipe
Our web users can simply input the recipe keyword and click the "Search" button to search for a recipe. If the keyword doesn't match to an existing recipe, then the page will return "recipe not found". 

#### Register and Login
Click the "register" button to create a new account or click the "login" button to log into your account.

#### Upload your recipe

After logged into your account, then you can click "Upload my recipe" and fill in the form. As the form is successfully submitted, you should be able to see your recipe on the home page. 

#### View and modify your recipes

Clicking "My recipes" button, you will see a table that list the brief information of each recipe. You can delete or modify or view the details of the recipe by clicking the buttons on the right hand side of each recipe.

Feel free to log out your account by clicking the logout button on the navigator bar.
